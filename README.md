# Talk-Bot
Talk-Bot is a mostly moderation focused bot for discord servers.

If you wish to invite the bot to your own server, use [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=831999775296978975&permissions=271969366&scope=bot) <sub>(there will be a setup guide coming in a future update to help use the bot correctly)</sub>

If you run into any technical issues <sub>(or are extremely confused due to the lack of help as said above)</sub>, please post an issue on this repo or contact me directly and i will reach back when available

## Requirements for hosting
Working python (Tested on 3.8, but should work on higher and some lower)

The discord module, the requests module, and the python-dotenv module (the rest come with python)

The bot auth goes in the .env file (See the example)
