# DISCONTINUED
The primary place this bot was used isn't active anymore, and I don't particularly enjoy maintaining this, so the repository is now archived. No further commits will be forthcoming, and the bot may stop working at any time.

# Talk-Bot
Talk-Bot is a mostly moderation focused bot for discord servers.

If you wish to invite the bot to your own server, use [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=831999775296978975&permissions=271969366&scope=bot) <sub>(there will be a setup guide coming in a future update to help use the bot correctly)</sub>

If you run into any technical issues <sub>(or are extremely confused due to the lack of help as said above)</sub>, please post an issue on this repo or contact me directly and i will reach back when available

## Requirements for hosting
Working python (Tested on 3.8, but should work on higher and some lower)

The discord module, the requests module (Only if using the NSFW module), and the python-dotenv module. The rest should come with python

The bot auth goes in the .env file (See the example)
