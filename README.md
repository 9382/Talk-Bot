# Talk-Bot
Talk-Bot is a mostly moderation focused bot for discord servers. All source code is public as i never saw a reason to keep projects like this private, even if they are _not so good_

## Requirements
Working python (Tested on 3.8, but should work on higher and some lower)

The discord module, the requests module, and the python-dotenv module (the rest come with python)

The bot auth goes in the .env file (See the example)
